# Pokémon Infinite Fusion: Multiplayer Extension

This is a hard coded plugin developed for the community made game "Pokémon Infinite Fusion" that adds a way to connect multiple clients to a server and play the game with your friends!
The plugin is currently only developed by me (Noam Rothschild), a 14yo kid with a passion for development, so nothing is perfect, and this is also my first project using the programming language "Ruby" and first experience using GitHub, so please notify me if any problems occur and tell me I suck at coding :) .

## FAQ

Can I use this without a redis database?
- No, a redis database is required
What do I need to do to get started?
- Follow the instructions above
I live far from my friend, will this affect the performance?

## Known bugs

Before you report an error/bug please make sure to see if the bug was already found.

- Player rotation not working
- Other player appears and moves on other maps - sadly this is one of those things that cannot be fixed using RPG-Maker XP (2009) and would require a full recreation of the game.
- Gifting a non-Fusion crashes the game
- If found more please report.

## How to install

## **No more need for that ugly-long tutorial! [A graphical game launcher has been released!](https://github.com/NoamRothschild/MultiplayerLauncher)**
(Ouch, Those 100~ deleted installation-guide lines hurted bad)

# That's it! 
hope you will enjoy my little project :)
- if any big attraction will come I will possibly come again and release another beta version, but this is all for now.
