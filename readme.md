# Pokemon Infinite Fusion: Multiplayer Extension

This is a plugin developed for the community made game "Pokemon Infinite Fusion" that adds a way to connect multiple clients to a server and play the game with your friends!
The plugin is currently only developed by me, a 14yo kid with a passion for devolepment, so nothing is perfect, and this is also my first project using the programming language "Ruby", so please notify me if any problems occur.
